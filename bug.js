This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo, specifically when trying to retrieve a value that doesn't exist.  The issue isn't immediately obvious because AsyncStorage's getItem method doesn't throw an error when it can't find a key; instead, it returns null.  However, if you don't properly handle this null value, subsequent operations can cause unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when using the retrieved value in calculations or conditional statements.

For example:

```javascript
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey');
const parsedValue = JSON.parse(value); //This will crash if value is null
```
